# Fire-Mod-Updater
Installs modpacks for basically any game based on what the user selects. Originally developed for paradox games, but should support most games as long as it has a standardized location to unpack mods too. 

# Building
Install all the prerequisits and then install [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). Run `build.bat` to build the script into a standalone executable.
